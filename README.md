**• Problem to solve:** 
The problem to be resolved is the lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly music application for Android devices. Existing music apps may lack certain features, have complicated user interfaces, or suffer from performance issues. Users often seek an all-in-one solution for managing their music library, discovering new songs, and enjoying personalized playlists [1].


**• Previous Works:**
A survey of previous works reveals various music applications for Android, including popular options like Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music. While these apps offer extensive music libraries and features, they may require paid subscriptions for full access. Additionally, some users prefer open-source alternatives like VLC Media Player or Shuttle Music Player for their simplicity and customization options [2].


**• Environment & Requirements:** 
  - Assumptions: The proposed application assumes that users have Android devices running on versions 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher and access to the internet for streaming music.

  - Operating Environment: The application will be developed for Android devices, compatible with smartphones and tablets.
  
  - Intended Usage: Provide a seamless and enjoyable music listening experience for users, allowing them to discover new music, create playlists, and enjoy personalized recommendations.



**• Approach**: 
Our solution is to develop MusicApp, an Android music application that combines a sleek user interface with powerful features for managing and enjoying music. The application will be designed using object-oriented principles to ensure scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance. We will adopt an agile development approach, starting with user research and requirements gathering, followed by design, implementation, testing, and deployment. The application will leverage modern Android development frameworks like Kotlin and Jetpack to ensure compatibility and performance.
